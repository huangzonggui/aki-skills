# High-Density Handnote Series Constraints

- Do not summarize or rewrite; preserve all original information points.
- Each image must cover all content assigned to it with no omissions.
- High-density layout is required (multi-column/grid/sections) but must stay readable.
- Small text is allowed; keep clear hierarchy and distinct sections.
- Keep titles clear; retain subheadings when needed; use short labels + 1-2 sentences.
- Use limited color accents for keywords; avoid decorative empty space.
- White background, thin lines, hand-drawn note look; no gradients, shadows, photos, or 3D.
- Output language must match the source article (use Chinese for Chinese articles).
- If the style template says "do not include too much information", ignore it.
