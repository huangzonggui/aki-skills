# Baoyu Style Library

Centralized style prompt library for reuse across multiple skills.

## Available Styles

- `handnote`: Concise hand-drawn note style for logical diagrams and summaries
- `masterpiece`: Warm, inspirational hand-drawn infographic with 3D lettering

## Files

- `references/styles/handnote.md`
- `references/styles/masterpiece.md`

## Usage

Reference these files from other skills when you need consistent styling:

- `../baoyu-style-library/references/styles/<style>.md`

This skill does not generate images by itself; it provides reusable prompt templates.
